          Hi. My name is Henry Harris. I am currently a 4th year Computer Science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, better known as Georgia Tech. I am also a candidate for a minor in Computing and Business through the Denning Technology and Management program. At school, most of my time outside of schoolwork is dedicated to being head teaching assistant for CS 2110.

          <h2>Story</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          My story with computers began way back when I as a middle schooler, playing Minecraft with my two brothers on our private server. Wanting to write custom server plugins, I started watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston">thenewboston</a>'s Java tutorials on YouTube. From the moment I saw the words "Hello World" pop up in my console, I knew programming was for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since, I've taken AP Computer Science, chosen Computer Science as my major, gotten heavily involved in the College of Computing, worked two software engineering internships, built countless projects, and to this day I still continue to love it just as much.

          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        </div>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy exercising and the great outdoors â€“ specifically lifting weights, playing basketball or volleyball, and hiking. I also love to travel the world as evident in my <a href="/beta/blog">blog</a>. My favorite trip ever is the trip to Morocco I took while studying abroad in Barcelona during the summer of 2018. There, we visited Fes, toured the Atlas Mountains, road camels into the Sahara desert where we spent the night in traditional Berber tents, played Moroccan drums with locals in Tingher Province, and navigated the bustling markets of Marrakech.</p>
