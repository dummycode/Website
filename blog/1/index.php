          I want you to picture a 500kg bull chasing you. Now, imagine it with sharp horns. Now, multiply it. By six to be exact. Now, place yourself in a small, crowded street with a thousand other people. Terrifying, eh? Well, purposefully putting myself in that exact same situation was the stupidest, yet best thing I've ever done.

          The festival of San Ferm√≠n is a week-long, historically rooted celebration held anually in the city of Pamplona, Spain. During this week, over a million Spainards and foreigners transform the quaint town of Pamplona into one giant party. My friends and I travelled from Spain, where we were studying for the summer, to Pamplona to join in on the fun.

          After a night out and a few short hours spent attempting to sleep on a park bench cuddling in the cold, we set off at sunrise to join in the daily tradition of running with the bulls.
