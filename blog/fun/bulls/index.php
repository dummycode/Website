                    I want you to picture a 500kg bull chasing you. Now, imagine it with sharp horns. Now, multiply it. By six to be exact.
                    Now, place yourself in a small, crowded street with a thousand other people.
                    Terrifying, eh? Well, purposefully putting myself in that exact same situation was the stupidest, yet best thing I've ever done.
